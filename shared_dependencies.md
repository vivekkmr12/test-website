Shared Dependencies:

1. HTML Elements: The "index.html" file will contain all the HTML elements that will be styled using the CSS files. These elements will have unique id names that will be used in the CSS files for styling. 

2. CSS Styles: The "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files will contain the CSS styles that will be applied to the HTML elements in the "index.html" file. These styles will be based on the id names of the HTML elements.

3. Tailwind CSS: The "tailwind.css" file will be imported into the "styles.css" file. This will allow the "styles.css" file to use the Tailwind CSS framework for styling the HTML elements.

4. Dark Theme: Both the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files will share a dark theme for styling the website, as per the user's request.

5. Clean Design: Both the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files will also share a clean design aesthetic, as per the user's request.
