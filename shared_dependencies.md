1. HTML and CSS: Both "index.html" and "styles.css" files share the HTML and CSS language dependency. HTML is used for structuring the website, while CSS is used for styling.

2. Tailwind CSS: "tailwind.css" is a utility-first CSS framework that is used for styling. It is shared between "index.html" and "styles.css" as it provides the classes and styles used in the HTML structure and custom CSS.

3. DOM Elements: The "index.html" file will contain various DOM elements that may be styled using both "styles.css" and "tailwind.css". These elements will have unique id names that are shared between the files. For example, ids like #navbar, #header, #footer, #main-content, etc.

4. CSS Classes: The CSS classes defined in "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" will be shared with "index.html". These classes will be used to apply styles to the HTML elements. For example, classes like .container, .text-center, .bg-dark, etc.

5. Media Queries: Media queries are used in "styles.css" to make the website responsive. These media queries will be shared with "index.html" to adjust the layout based on different screen sizes.

6. Link and Script Tags: The "index.html" file will contain link tags to link the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. This is a shared dependency as the HTML file needs to reference the CSS files to apply the styles.

7. Color Schemes and Fonts: The color schemes and fonts used in the website will be shared between all three files. The color scheme will be defined in "tailwind.css" and "styles.css", and used in "index.html". The same applies to the fonts used.

8. Visual Elements: The visual elements like clean borders and gradients will be defined in "styles.css" and "tailwind.css", and used in "index.html".
